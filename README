Some python functions I wrote to help me play Kenken.

I would typically open it up as "python -i kenken.py" and
execute functions to help me narrow down possibilities for a given
Kenken block.

This is from 2014, before I cared much about style, so it reads
very ugly, but there is a scary level of detail and logic in here
that I thought worth displaying.

Enjoy!
